<td><font>(229kb)</font></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><font><u><strong>Section 12 : Verification of Municipal taxes</strong></u><br><br>Section 229 of the Constitution introduced the regulatory framework on municipal fiscal powers and functions. All municipal taxes accordingly need to comply with the regulatory framework as contained in various pieces of national legislation. Municipal property rates are regulated through the Local Government: Municipal Property Rates Act whilst all other municipal taxes are regulated through the Municipal Fiscal Powers and Functions Act (MFPFA). As a comprehensive list of all municipal taxes did not exist prior to the introduction of the MFPFA, legislative provision was made in the Act that such taxes be verified within two years after enactment of the MFPFA, i.e. by 7 September 2009. <br><br>Section 12 of the MFPFA requires that all municipalities apply to the Minister of Finance to approve any taxes that they levied prior to enactment of the Act, other than property rates, the former RSC levies and any surcharges on user charges/tariffs that it levied prior to the Act (surcharges will be regulated through norms and standards in terms of section 8 of the Act). <br><br>Should a municipality have any taxes (other than property rates and surcharges on a user charge/tariff) and no application is made by a municipality to the Minister of Finance to continue imposing taxes that existed prior to the Act, such municipal taxes will automatically lapse on 7 September 2009. Should the Minister of Finance not approve the continuation of a municipal tax, such municipal tax will lapse six months after the Minister’s notification. <br><br/><br><br></font>
